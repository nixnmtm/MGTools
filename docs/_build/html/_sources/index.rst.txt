Welcome to Rigidity Grpahs's documentation!
==================================================

In rigidity graph, edges that connect the nodes of amino acid residues are calculated from atomic fluctuations
(obtained from fluctuation matching).
The adjacency matrix (A) and the degree matrix (D) of the weighted graph are also defined based on the calculated edges.
The molecular graph was then characterized by analyzing the signless Laplacian matrix, (K=A+D).
We showed that this framework can be used to effectively dissect the inter-reside couplings due to backbone-backbone,
backbone-sidechain, and sidechain-sidechain interactions, hence revealing the mechanical architecture of a protein structure.
We also analyze the functional implications of the MGT in extracting allosteric communication and functionally important residues in proteins.

We eigenvalue decompose the K matrix as shown in :eq:`kmat` and calculate persistance of each mode to capture important residues.

Fluctuation Matching
--------------------

Fluctuation matching is a process where the variances of bond fluctuations obtained from CG-ENM through
normal mode analysis (NMA) and all-atom MD through trajectories are matched by adjusting the force constants in the ENM
to reproduce the bond fluctuations observed in all-atom MD. The fluctuation matching results in force constant matrix of
all CG bead interactions. The coupling strength is obtained by summing up the force constants of their respective CG
sites. This coupling strength dataframe will be the input for :class:`core.BuildMG`.
